Cube diagrams are special 3-dimensional representations of knots and links.  (See [Baldridge and Lowrance](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/0811.0225)). The project contains a list of cube diagrams for all knots less than 8 crossings (plus several other knots and links) and code for displaying and manipulating cube diagrams, including code for calculating cube homology, a variant of knot Floer Homology.  The code can also display and manipulate grid diagrams of the same knots and links.  The code is written in Mathematica 7.0.
